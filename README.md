# HHA507_ANOVAs
Performed ANOVAs (one way and factorial) on a 2014 dataset about mental health. Transformed the intial dataset to group explicit genders under three broad categories for easier reference, and filtered to only include those working in the United States and working within the tech industry.

Will follow up with a more recent dataset to show the progression of trends as we normalize mental health discussions.
